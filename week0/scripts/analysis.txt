1. What happens when you close one or the other?

answer:
        If I turned off the listener then talker is continuously trying to 
    publish but it can't do that. When I turned off the talker then listener 
    doesn't hear anything. 


2. What happens when you close the core node?

answer: 
        Suppose the talker and the listener are continuously working and at that moment
    I turn off the core node then it actually doesn't make any impact on the communication
    on these two ongoing talker and listener node. But, if I stop one of them
    (listener or talker) and then again try to run then it actually can't able to 
    reconnect with other node. 


3. What happens when you change the rate for the talker?
    default is 10
    rate = 1
    rate = 100
    rate = 100000
    rate = 0.1
    rate = 0.001

answer: 
        It works like frequency. If I set 10 then the talker actually generate 10 message in
    a second and send to listener. If I set 0.1 then the talker actually generate 1 message in
    every 10 seconds and send it to listener. So, the rate actually represents number of message
    in each second. 


4. What happens when you start 2 talker nodes? & 5. What happens when you start 2 listener nodes?

answer: 
        Both talker actually generate message and send then to each listener. 
    But two listener actually get the message from both talker. 
    Talker 1 and talker 2 individually generate message and send the messages to both 
    listener.
