## set up ROS environment

## fork and clone repository

First, navigate to the hri_projects_2023 page: https://github.com/UNR-RoboticsResearchLab/hri_projects_2023

You should create a version under your github id. Then clone your repository:

```
cd ~/hri2023/src
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR GITHUB ID HERE>/hri_projects_2023
```

this will clone the repo into your ROS package source directory.

Next we want to test the compile of the system:

```
cd ~/hri2023
catkin_make
```

assuming all goes well, then you should be able to get to the week 0 package using the roscd command:

```
roscd week1
```

if you've gotten to the directory: ~/hri2023/src/hri_projects_2023/week0

## Navigate to the week 0 project readme

Each project week will have a readme file with instructions for the week, navigate to the week1 directory on github to see the instruction for the week.
