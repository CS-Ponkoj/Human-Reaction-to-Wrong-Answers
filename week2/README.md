# Week 2 Tutorial

This week we're going to move the focus from basic robot actions to actions around people. Major deliverables this week:

- Detecting a person in simulation with a laser
- Using the transform library and ROS visualizer (rviz)
- Moving toward a goal with obstacle avoidance
- Creating a data recording using rosbag
- Using a rosbag recording

## detecting a person in sim with a laser

First, let's open up our simulator again:

```
roslaunch week1 basic_world.launch
```

In this world, we just have a robot and a box. I'm making a new world file to include a 'person', let's take a look:

```
roslaunch week2 person_world.launch
```
