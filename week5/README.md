# Week 5 Tutorial

This week we're going to record a perception dataset for different forms of groups/coalitions for comparison.

## Week4 Results

Once you've completed your week4 tasks, we're going to start off by recording some data of the group behavior for 3 different conditions:

- no group interaction;
- line group interaction; and

Here's the requirements for a good recording:

- complete: all data required to recreate the group observation from a recording are present (this means recording all the correct topics)
- compact: if every file is 1G large, then it won't be easy to move around (files should definitely be less than 100M)
- distinct: each data recording should be different from others, the same data over and over are bad for training
-
